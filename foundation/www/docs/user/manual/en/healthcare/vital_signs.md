# Vital Signs
ERPNext Healthcare helps you to capture Vital Signs of Patients at any point of time. All Vitals information over time can be viewed as part of the Patient's Medical History. You can create a new document and record Vital Signs of a Patient directly by

`Healthcare > Consultation > Vital Signs > New Vital Signs`
