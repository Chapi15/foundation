# Vital Signs
ERPNext Healthcare helps you to capture Vital Signs of Patients at any point of time. All Vitals information over time can be viewed as part of the Patient's Medical History. You can create a new document and record Vital Signs of a Patient directly by

`Healthcare > Patient Care > Vital Signs`

You can also create and record vitals for a patient from Patient Appointment, the Patient Encounter or the Patient master documents by using the `Create > Vital Signs` button

You can select the Patient for whom you are recording the vitals and start by entering each of the fields. Normal values or ranges are provided for ease of assessment. An automated BMI calculator is also made available.
