# Pharmacy
ERPNext Healthcare do not have a Pharmacy module as such. However, [ERPNext Stock](https://erpnext.org/docs/user/manual/en/stock), [Buying](https://erpnext.org/docs/user/manual/en/buying) and [Accounts](https://erpnext.org/docs/user/manual/en/accounts) Module will do all that's needed to seamlessly manage your Pharmacy Stock as well as other supplies, their billing and purchases.

For a Healthcare setup, features like [Items](https://erpnext.org/docs/user/manual/en/stock/item) with Reorder Levels, [Batch Number and Expiry Dates](https://erpnext.org/docs/user/manual/en/stock/batch) etc. will be worth looking at.

ERPNext Healthcare adds a few custom fields to `Item` document so that you can effectively configure medicines.
