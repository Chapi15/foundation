# Clinic / Practice

You can easily configure the masters for setting up ERPNext Healthcare for your practice. Below are a list of documents which helps you speed up data entry. Also read [Healthcare Settings](https://erpnext.org/docs/user/manual/en/healthcare/setup/healthcare_settings) for setting up the Healthcare module.

### Medical Department
To organize your clinic into departments, you can create multiple Medical Departments.

`Healthcare > Setup > Medical Department > New Medical Department`

### Appointment Type
You can create masters for various type of Appointments. Appointment Type allows you to predefine the duration of the appointment so that while selecting Appointment Type, the duration gets set in the Appointment automatically. You can also set a color for each Appointment Type which will help you identify the appointments of a particular type in the Calendar view.

`Healthcare > Setup > Appointment Type > New Appointment Type`

### Prescription Dosage & Duration
You can configure different dosages to be used while prescribing medication to patients. You can name the Prescription dosage in anyway you want (for example, BID or I-0-I), and then set the strength of the drug and the times at which it should be administered.

`Healthcare > Setup > Prescription Dosage > New Prescription Dosage`

`Healthcare > Setup > Prescription Duration > New Prescription Duration`

### Complaint and Diagnosis
To ease the data entry while recording the encounter impression, ERPNext Healthcare allows you to save each of the Complaint / Diagnosis data you enter, from the Consultation screen itself. This way, the database keeps building a list of all complaints and diagnosis you entered. Later on, every time you start keying in, you will be able to select the previously entered word / sentence from the search field. You can also configure the masters manually.

`Healthcare > Setup > Complaints > New Complaint`

`Healthcare > Setup > Diagnosis > New Diagnosis`
