				<h3>Things to Do</h3>
				<ul class="list">
					<li>There are lots of places to visit from ancient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephanta_Caves">Buddhist caves</a>
						to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_of_India">British monuments</a> across the city.</li>
					<li>You can enjoy the view of the sea at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ASP8KxDpwW3BEvwZ9">Bandstand</a> at Bandra and <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/QhYufjoci1LnUhSR7">Marine Drive</a> at Churchgate.</li>
					<li>A culinary experience like no other, Mumbai hosts many amazing <a href="https://zoma.to/uc/3-lYlbO">Cafes and Bars.</a></li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="mb-5">
				<h3>Hotels to Stay</h3>
				<ul class="list">
					<li>Hotels in Mumbai are generally expensive, so avoid staying very close to the venue. There are a lot of hotels around the airport and that might be the best option for getting a deal.</li>
					<li>The venue would be around 30-45 mins for the airport based on where you are.</li>
					<li><a href='https://www.cleartrip.com/hotels/india/mumbai/'>Cleartrip</a> might have the best deals. <a href='https://www.airbnb.co.in/s/Mumbai--India'>Airbnb</a> might also have good options.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="mb-5">
				<h3>Getting Around</h3>
				<ul class="list">
					<li><a href='https://www.uber.com/'>Uber</a> and <a href='https://www.olacabs.com/'>Ola Cabs</a> are app based taxi services that will work very well. We 100% recommend these over local taxis and auto-rickshaws (tuk-tuks) which are likely to over-charge out station passengers.</li>
					<li>If you do travel by local taxis or auto-rickshaws, they are not allowed to charge a fare greater than the one calculated by the meter after the trip.</li>
					<li>If you are up for some adventure, you can try the Mumbai local trains. Here's a <a href="https://www.tripsavvy.com/how-to-ride-mumbai-local-train-1539513">guide</a> for that.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="mb-5">
				<h3>Venue</h3>
				<ul class="list">
					<li>The venue is at the <a href='https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Mysore+Association+Auditorium,+393,+Bhau+Daji+Road,+Matunga+East,+Mumbai,+Maharashtra+400019/@19.0284125,72.8549753,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x3be7cf2892c6d671:0xd31576f646dcbc86'>Mysore Association Auditorium</a> and has all modern facilities you would expect from a venue. It is centrally located and easily accessible from all corners.</li>
